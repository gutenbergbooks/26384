<h2>Separation and Service.</h2>

<h2>Numbers vi, vii.</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTORY.</h3>

<p>For many years these chapters had no special interest to me; but I have
never ceased to be thankful that I was early led to read the Word of <span class="smcap">God</span>
in regular course: it was through this habit that these chapters first
became specially precious to me. I was travelling on a missionary tour
in the province of <span class="smcap">Cheh-kiang</span>, and had to pass the night in a very
wicked town. All the inns were dreadful places; and the people seemed to
have their consciences seared, and their hearts sealed against the
Truth. My own heart was oppressed, and could find no relief; and I awoke
the next<span class='pagenum'><a name="page8" id="page8">[Pg 8]</a></span> morning much cast down, and feeling spiritually hungry and
thirsty indeed.</p>

<p>On opening my Bible at the seventh chapter of Numbers, I felt as though
I could not then read that long chapter of repetitions; that I <i>must</i>
turn to some chapter that would feed my soul. And yet I was not happy in
leaving my regular portion; so after a little conflict I resolved to
read it, praying to <span class="smcap">God</span> to bless me, even through Numb. vii. I fear
there was not much faith in the prayer; but oh! how abundantly it was
answered, and what a feast <span class="smcap">God</span> gave me! He revealed to me His own great
heart of love, and gave me the key to understand this and the previous
chapter as never before. May <span class="smcap">God</span> make our meditations upon them as
helpful to others as they were then and have ever since continued to be
to myself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="page9" id="page9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>Much is revealed in these chapters in germ which is more fully brought
out in the New Testament. Under the Old Covenant many blessings were
enjoyed in measure and for a season, which in this dispensation are ours
in their fulness and permanence. For instance, the atoning sacrifices of
the seventh month had to be repeated every year; but <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, in offering
Himself once for all, perfected for ever them that are sanctified. The
Psalmist needed to pray, "Take not Thy <span class="smcap">Holy Spirit</span> from me;" but <span class="smcap">Christ</span>
has given us the <span class="smcap">Comforter</span> to abide with us for ever. In like manner the
Israelite might vow the vow of a Nazarite and separate himself unto <span class="smcap">God</span>
for a season; but it is the privilege of the Christian believer to know
himself as always separated to <span class="smcap">God</span>. Many other lessons, which are<span class='pagenum'><a name="page10" id="page10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
hidden from careless and superficial readers, are suggested by these
chapters, which the <span class="smcap">Holy Spirit</span> will reveal to prayerful students of His
most precious and most perfect Book.</p>

<p>The portions we have selected consist of first a short chapter, and then
a very long one, which at first sight appears to have no special
connection with it. But on more careful reflection we shall see that the
order of the subjects referred to shows that there is really a natural
and close connection between them. We shall find that Separation to <span class="smcap">God</span>
is followed by Blessing from <span class="smcap">God</span>; and that those who receive large
blessing from Him, in turn render to Him acceptable Service: service in
which <span class="smcap">God</span> takes delight, and which He places in everlasting
remembrance.</p>

<h2>PART I.</h2>

<h2>Separation to <span class="smcap">God</span>.</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">Numb. vi. 1-21.</span></h2>

<h3>THE INSTITUTION OF THE ORDER OF NAZARITES.</h3>


<p>The first twenty-one verses of Numb. vi. give us an account of the
institution and ordinances of the order of Nazarites. And let us note at
the outset that this institution, like every other good and perfect
gift, came from above; that <span class="smcap">God</span> Himself gave this privilege&mdash;unasked&mdash;to
His people; thereby showing His desire that "whosoever will" of His
people may be brought into closest relationship to Himself.</p>

<p>It was very gracious of <span class="smcap">God</span> to <i>permit</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="page12" id="page12">[Pg 12]</a></span> His people to become Nazarites.
Israel might have been "a kingdom of priests;" but through their own sin
they had nationally forfeited this privilege, and a special family had
been set apart to the priesthood. <span class="smcap">God</span>, however, still opened the way for
individuals who wished to draw near to Him to do so, and for any period
which their own hearts might dictate.</p>

<p>But it is important to notice that though the vow might only be one of
temporary consecration, yet it involved while it lasted an</p>

<p class="center">ABSOLUTE ACCEPTANCE</p>

<p>of the will of <span class="smcap">God</span>, even in regard to matters which might appear trivial
and unimportant. So, in the present day, <span class="smcap">God</span> is willing to give to His
people fulness of blessing, but it must be on<span class='pagenum'><a name="page13" id="page13">[Pg 13]</a></span> His own lines. Though we
are not our own, it is, alas! possible to live as though we were;
devotion to <span class="smcap">God</span> is still a voluntary thing; hence the differences of
attainment among Christians. While salvation is a free gift, the
"winning <span class="smcap">Christ</span>" can only be through unreserved consecration and
unquestioning obedience. Nor is this a hardship, but the highest
privilege.</p>

<p>Let us now look into the law of the Nazarite.</p>


<h3>IMPLICIT OBEDIENCE: verses 3, 4.</h3>

<p class="blockquot"><i>"He shall separate himself from wine and strong drink, and shall drink
no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink
any liquor of grapes, nor eat moist grapes, or dried. All the days of
his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the vine tree, from
the kernels even to the husk."</i></p>

<p>The first thing that we note is, that as the obedience of Adam was
tested<span class='pagenum'><a name="page14" id="page14">[Pg 14]</a></span> in the Garden by the prohibition of one tree&mdash;a tree pleasant to
look upon, and good for food&mdash;so was the obedience of the Nazarite
tested. He was not forbidden to eat poison berries, nor was he merely
required to abstain from the wine and strong drink which might easily
become a snare; fresh grapes and dried raisins were equally prohibited.
It was not that the thing was harmful in itself, but that the doing the
will of <span class="smcap">God</span>, in a matter of seeming indifference, was essential to his
acceptance.</p>

<p>Not less true is this of the Christian Nazarite. Whether he eat or
drink, or whatsoever he do, the will of <span class="smcap">God</span> and not self-indulgence must
be his one aim. Christians often get into perplexity about worldly
allurements by asking, Where is the sin of this, or the danger of that?
There <i>may</i> be danger<span class='pagenum'><a name="page15" id="page15">[Pg 15]</a></span> that the questioner cannot see: Satan's baits
often skilfully conceal a sharp hook; but supposing that the thing be
harmless, it does not follow that it would be pleasing to <span class="smcap">God</span>, or
spiritually helpful.</p>

<p>The fruit of the vine is a type of earth-born pleasures; those who would
enjoy Nazarite nearness to <span class="smcap">God</span> must count His love "better than wine."
To win <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, the Apostle Paul gladly suffered the loss of all things,
and counted them as dross and dung for the excellency of the knowledge
of <span class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span> his <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. The things he gave up were not bad things, but
good&mdash;things that in themselves were gain to him; and <span class="smcap">Christ</span> Himself for
our redemption emptied Himself, and came to seek not His own, but the
will of Him that sent Him.</p>

<p>The highest service demands the<span class='pagenum'><a name="page16" id="page16">[Pg 16]</a></span> greatest sacrifice, but it secures the
fullest blessing and the greatest fruitfulness. <i><span class="smcap">Christ</span> could not remain
in His <span class="smcap">Father's</span> bosom and redeem the world; missionaries cannot win
the heathen and enjoy their home surroundings; nor can they be
adequately sustained without the loving sacrifices of many friends and
donors. You, dear reader, know th <span class="smcap">Master's</span> choice; what is <span class="smcap">YOURS</span>?
is it to do His will even if it mean to leave all for Him, to give all
to Him?</i></p>

<h3>ENTIRE CONSECRATION: verse 5.</h3>

<p class="blockquot"><i>"All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come
upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in the which he separateth
himself unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, he shall be holy, and shall let the locks of
the hair of his head grow."</i></p>

<p>We have already seen that <span class="smcap">God</span> tested the obedience of the Nazarite in
the matter of food: pleasing <span class="smcap">God</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="page17" id="page17">[Pg 17]</a></span> was rather to be chosen than the most
tempting cluster of grapes. But in the foregoing words we find that his
obedience is further tested, and this in a way which to many might prove
a more severe trial. <span class="smcap">God</span> claims the right of determining the personal
appearance of His servant, and directs that separated ones should be
manifestly such. To many minds there is the greatest shrinking from
appearing peculiar; but <span class="smcap">God</span> would often have His people unmistakably
peculiar. We sometimes hear the argument, "all the world" thinks this,
or does that, given as a reason for our doing likewise; but that is an
argument that should have no weight with the Christian, who is commanded
<i>not</i> to be conformed to the world. While we are not to seek to be
peculiar for its own sake, we are not to hesitate to be so when duty to<span class='pagenum'><a name="page18" id="page18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">God</span> renders it necessary, or when the privilege of self-denial for the
benefit of others calls for it.</p>

<p>Further, this command again reminded the Nazarite that he was not his
own, but was utterly the <span class="smcap">Lord's</span>; that <span class="smcap">God</span> claimed the very hair of his
head. He was not at liberty to cut or trim it as he saw fit, nor to wear
it as long or as short as might be agreeable to himself. So absolute was
<span class="smcap">God's</span> claim upon him, that not merely while his vow lasted was that hair
to be recognised as <span class="smcap">God's</span> possession, but when his vow was fulfilled the
whole of it was to be shaved off, and was to be burnt upon the altar.
Like the burnt-offering, it was to be recognised as for <span class="smcap">God's</span> use alone,
whether or not any utilitarian purpose were accomplished by the
sacrifice.</p>

<p>So now, in the present dispensation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="page19" id="page19">[Pg 19]</a></span> we are told "the very hairs of
your head are all numbered"&mdash;so minute is <span class="smcap">God's</span> care for His people, so
watchful is He over all that affects them. It is beautiful to see the
fond love of a young mother as she passes her fingers through the silken
locks of her darling child&mdash;her treasure and her delight; <i>but she never
counts those hairs</i>. He only, who is the source of mother-love, does
that! And shall not <i>we</i>, who are not our own, but bought with a price,
<i>gladly</i> render to Him <i>all</i> we are and have&mdash;every member of our body,
every fibre of our being, every faculty of our mind, all our will-power,
and all our love?</p>

<h3>HOLINESS TO THE LORD: verses 6-8.</h3>

<p class="blockquot"><i>"All the days that he separateth himself unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> he shall
come at no dead body. He shall not make himself unclean for his</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="page20" id="page20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
<i>father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister,
when they die; because the consecration of his <span class="smcap">God</span> is upon his
head. All the days of his separation he is holy unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>."</i></p>

<p>Here we have a most solemn and important prohibition&mdash;to refrain from
all uncleanness caused by contact with death. Death is the wages of sin:
the consecrated one was alike to keep aloof from sin and from its
consequences.</p>

<p>No requirement of <span class="smcap">God's</span> Word is more clear than the command to honour
and obey our earthly parents; but even for his father or mother a
Nazarite might not <i>defile</i> himself: "he that loveth father or mother
more than <span class="smcap">Me</span>, is not worthy of <span class="smcap">Me</span>."</p>

<p>But let no young Christian think lightly of the requirements of parents,
when these do <i>not</i> conflict with <span class="smcap">God's</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="page21" id="page21">[Pg 21]</a></span> written Word. Young Christians
are sometimes distressed because their desire to preach the Gospel to
the heathen has been opposed by parents: such should be encouraged to
<i>thank</i> <span class="smcap">God</span> for the obstacle; and to seek by prayer its removal. When
they have learnt to move man through <span class="smcap">God</span> at home, they will be the
better prepared to do the same thing in the mission-field. Where there
is fitness for the work, the way will probably be made plain after a
time of patient waiting.</p>

<p>These verses teach us that mere contact with death is defiling: how vain
then is the imagination of the unconverted that by dead works&mdash;the best
efforts of those who are themselves dead in trespasses and sins&mdash;they
can render themselves acceptable to <span class="smcap">God</span>! The good works of the unsaved
may indeed benefit their fellow-creatures;<span class='pagenum'><a name="page22" id="page22">[Pg 22]</a></span> but until life in <span class="smcap">Christ</span> has
been received, they cannot please <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>

<h3>UNWITTING DEFILEMENT: verses 9-12.</h3>

<p class="blockquot"><i>"If any man die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled the head
of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in the day of his
cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it. And on the eighth
day he shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons, to the
priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the
priest shall offer the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a
burnt-offering, and make an atonement for him, for that he sinned
by the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day. And he shall
consecrate unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> the days of his separation, and shall
bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass-offering: but the
days that were before shall be lost, because his separation was
defiled."</i></p>

<p>A most important truth is here taught&mdash;that even unwitting contact with
death might bring sin upon the Nazarite. Sometimes we are tempted<span class='pagenum'><a name="page23" id="page23">[Pg 23]</a></span> to
excuse ourselves, and to forget the absolute sinfulness of sin, apart
altogether from the question of premeditation, or even of consciousness,
<i>at the time</i>, on our part. The one who became defiled, <i>was defiled</i>,
whether intentionally or not; <span class="smcap">God's</span> requirement was absolute, and where
not fulfilled the vow was broken; the sin-offering had to be offered,
and the service recommenced.</p>

<h3>THE HEINOUSNESS OF SIN.</h3>

<p>The teaching here, and that of offerings for sins of ignorance, is much
needed in this day, when there is a dangerous tendency in some quarters
to regard sin as misfortune, and not as guilt. The awful <i>character</i> of
sin is shown to mankind by its <i>consequences</i>. Man's heart is so
darkened by the Fall,<span class='pagenum'><a name="page24" id="page24">[Pg 24]</a></span> and by personal sinfulness, that otherwise he
would regard sin as a very small matter. But when we think of all the
pain that men and women have endured since the Creation, of all the
miseries of which this world has been witness, of all the sufferings of
the animal creation, and of the eternal as well as temporal consequences
of sin, we must see that that which has brought such a harvest of misery
into the world is far more awful than sin-blinded men have thought it to
be.</p>

<p>The highest evidence, however, of the terrible character of sin is to be
found at the Cross; that it needed such a sacrifice&mdash;the sacrifice of
the <span class="smcap">Son</span> of <span class="smcap">God</span>&mdash;to bring in atonement and everlasting salvation, is
surely the most convincing proof of its heinous character.</p>

<p>Death was brought into the world by<span class='pagenum'><a name="page25" id="page25">[Pg 25]</a></span> sin; and, like all the other
consequences of sin, it is loathsome and defiling. Man seeks to adorn
death; the pageantry of the funeral, the attractiveness of the cemetery,
all show this. The Egyptian sought in vain to make the mortal body
incorruptible by embalming it. But we have to bury our dead out of our
sight, and the believer is taught to look forward to the resurrection.</p>

<h3>CLEANSING ONLY THROUGH SACRIFICE.</h3>

<p>Let us not lose sight of the fact that the accidental death of any one
near the Nazarite&mdash;that the thoughtless putting forth of the hand
even&mdash;might violate his vow of consecration as truly, if not as
guiltily, as an act of deliberate transgression; in either case all the
previous time was lost, and the period of consecration had to be
recommenced<span class='pagenum'><a name="page26" id="page26">[Pg 26]</a></span> after his cleansing. And that cleansing could only be
brought about through sacrifice; the sin-offering must <i>die</i>; the
burnt-offering must <i>die</i>; without shedding of blood there could be no
remission. So serious was the effect of transgression&mdash;and yet, thank
<span class="smcap">God</span>, it was not irremediable.</p>

<p>The bearing of this on the life of consecration to <span class="smcap">God</span> in the present
day is important. Nearness to <span class="smcap">God</span> calls for tenderness of conscience,
thoughtfulness in service, and implicit obedience. If we become
conscious of the slightest failure, even through inadvertence, let us
not excuse it, but at once humble ourselves before <span class="smcap">God</span>, and confess it,
seeking forgiveness and cleansing on the ground of the accepted
sacrifice of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>. <span class="smcap">God's</span> Word is, "If we confess our sins, He is
faithful and just to forgive us our<span class='pagenum'><a name="page27" id="page27">[Pg 27]</a></span> sins, and <i>to cleanse us</i> from all
unrighteousness." This cleansing must be accepted by faith, and a walk
"in the light" be at once resumed. And shall we not reverently ask and
trust the <span class="smcap">Holy Spirit</span> to guard and keep us from inadvertence, and to
bring to our remembrance those things which we may be in danger of
forgetting?</p>

<h3>ACCEPTANCE ONLY IN CHRIST: verses 13-15.</h3>

<p class="blockquot"><i>"And this is the law of the Nazarite, when the days of his
separation are fulfilled: he shall be brought unto the door of the
tabernacle of the congregation; And he shall offer his offering
unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, one he-lamb of the first year without blemish for
a burnt-offering, and one ewe-lamb of the first year without
blemish for a sin-offering, and one ram without blemish for
peace-offerings, and a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine
flour mingled with oil, and wafers of unleavened bread anointed
with oil,</i> <span class='pagenum'><a name="page28" id="page28">[Pg 28]</a></span><i>and their meat-offering, and their drink-offerings."</i></p>

<p>Having seen the character of the vow of the Nazarite, and of the
ordinances to be observed should the vow be violated, the case of a
Nazarite who has duly fulfilled his vow is next dealt with. He has
carried out all <span class="smcap">God's</span> requirements, and his conscience is void of
offence: before <span class="smcap">God</span> and man he is blameless. May he not now congratulate
himself, and claim some measure of merit, seeing he has rendered to <span class="smcap">God</span>
an acceptable service, and among men has borne a consistent testimony?
The offerings to be made on the conclusion of his vow give an impressive
answer to this question, and bring out the important difference between
being <i>blameless</i> and being <i>sinless</i>. Having fulfilled the ordinances
he was blameless; but the necessity<span class='pagenum'><a name="page29" id="page29">[Pg 29]</a></span> alike for sin-offering, for
burnt-offering, and for peace offering, remind us of the sin of our holy
things; and that not our worst, but our best, is only acceptable to <span class="smcap">God</span>
through the atonement of our <span class="smcap">Lord Jesus Christ</span>.</p>

<p>While, however, the best services of the believer can neither give full
satisfaction to his own enlightened conscience, nor be acceptable to <span class="smcap">God</span>
save through <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>, it is very blessed to know how fully all his
needs are met in <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, and how truly he is accepted in Him, and
enabled to give very real joy to <span class="smcap">God</span> our <span class="smcap">Father</span>, which issues in the
bestowal of His richest blessings. Very imperfect&mdash;sometimes worse than
useless, is the attempt of a little child to please and serve its
parent; but where the parent sees an effort to do his will, and to give
him pleasure, is not the service<span class='pagenum'><a name="page30" id="page30">[Pg 30]</a></span> gladly accepted, and the parent's
heart greatly rejoiced? Thus it is our privilege to be Nazarites, only
and always Nazarites, and through <span class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span> to give joy and
satisfaction by our imperfect service to our heavenly <span class="smcap">Father</span>. The
following anonymous lines, taken from a leaflet,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">A</a> beautifully

<table class="center" summary="poetry">
<tr>

<p>
I was sitting alone in the twilight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With spirit troubled and vexed,</span><br />
With thoughts that were morbid and gloomy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And faith that was sadly perplexed.</span></p>

<p>Some homely work I was doing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the child of my love and care;</span><br />
Some stitches half-wearily setting<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the endless need of repair.</span></p>

<p>But my thoughts were about "the building,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The work some day to be tried;</span><br />
And that only the gold and the silver,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the precious stones should abide;</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page31" id="page31">[Pg 31]</a></span>And, remembering my own poor efforts,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The wretched work I had done,</span><br />
And, even when trying most truly,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The meagre success I had won;</span></p>

<p>"It is nothing but wood, hay, and stubble,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I said; "it will all be burned&mdash;</span><br />
This useless fruit of the talents<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One day to be returned;</span></p>

<p>"And I have so longed to serve Him,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sometimes I <i>know</i> I have tried;</span><br />
But I'm sure, when He sees such a building,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He will never let it abide."</span></p>

<p>Just then, as I turned the garment<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That no rent should be left behind,</span><br />
My eye caught an odd little bungle<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of mending and patchwork combined.</span></p>

<p>My heart grew suddenly tender,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And something blinded my eyes,</span><br />
With one of those sweet intuitions<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That sometimes makes us so wise.</span></p>

<p>Dear child, she wanted to help me;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I knew 'twas the best she could do;</span><br />
But oh, what a botch she had made it&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The grey mis-matching the blue!</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page32" id="page32">[Pg 32]</a></span>And yet&mdash;can you understand it?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a tender smile and a tear,</span><br />
And a half-compassionate yearning,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I felt her grown more dear.</span></p>

<p>Then a sweet voice broke the silence,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the dear Lord said to me&mdash;</span><br />
"Art thou tenderer for the little child<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than I am tender for thee."</span></p>

<p>Then straightway I knew His meaning,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So full of compassion and love;</span><br />
And my faith came back to its Refuge,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like the glad returning dove.</span></p>

<p>For I thought when the Master Builder<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Comes down His temple to view,</span><br />
To see what rents must be mended,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And what must be builded anew;</span></p>

<p>Perhaps, as He looks o'er the building,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He will bring my work to the light,</span><br />
And, seeing the marring and bungling,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And how far it all is from right,</span></p>

<p>He will feel as I felt for my darling,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And will say as I said for her&mdash;</span><br />
"Dear child, she wanted to help me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And love for me was the spur;</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page33" id="page33">[Pg 33]</a></span>"And, for the real love that was in it,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The work shall seem perfect as mine;</span><br />
And because it was willing service,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I will crown it with plaudit divine."</span></p>

<p>And there, in the deepening twilight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I seemed to be clasping a Hand,</span><br />
And to feel a great love constraining me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stronger than any command.</span></p>

<p>Then I knew, by the thrill of sweetness,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Twas the hand of the Blessed One,</span><br />
Which would tenderly guide and hold me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till all the labour is done.</span></p>

<p>So my thoughts are never more gloomy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My faith no longer is dim:</span><br />
But my heart is strong and restful,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And mine eyes are unto <span class="smcap">Him</span>.</span></p>

<h3>THE PRESENTATION OF THE NAZARITE.</h3>

<p>Let us now look into the law of the Nazarite when the days of his
separation were fulfilled. The first thing that strikes our notice is,
"He shall be brought," not, he shall come. Why is<span class='pagenum'><a name="page34" id="page34">[Pg 34]</a></span> this? and why is it
that the law is so explicit as to every detail of ritual and service,
scarcely leaving any room for voluntary action?&mdash;we say <i>scarcely</i>,
because in the twenty-first verse there is one little clause, "Beside
that that his hand shall get," which does leave room for additional
tokens of gratitude and love.</p>

<p>The answer seems to be, that the voluntary part of Nazarite service lay
first and chiefly in the surrender to become a Nazarite. In that
position he was not his own, as we have pointed out, and the <span class="smcap">Master</span> whom
he served naturally and consistently directed the service.</p>

<p>Again, does not, "He shall be brought" imply that, Nazarite as he was,
he still needed priestly ministration to present himself, and his
finished service, before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>? And our<span class='pagenum'><a name="page35" id="page35">[Pg 35]</a></span> <span class="smcap">High Priest</span>, who is now able
to keep us from falling to the end of our surrendered service, waits to
present us with exceeding joy, "faultless before the presence of His
glory"&mdash;"holy and unblameable and unreproveable in His sight."</p>

<h3>THE LAW OF THE OFFERINGS.</h3>

<p>When we come to the offerings enumerated in v. 14, we notice that they
are mentioned in the almost invariable <i>order of enumeration</i>&mdash;first the
burnt-offering, then the sin-offering, and lastly the peace offering;
but when in v. 16 we come to the offering up of the sacrifices, we
notice that <i>as always</i> the sin-offering is the <i>first to be offered</i>.</p>

<p>It is somewhat remarkable that the actual order of offering, and the
order of enumeration should not correspond;<span class='pagenum'><a name="page36" id="page36">[Pg 36]</a></span> and it is likewise
noteworthy that the sacrifice which was always offered first, when
offered at all, was <i>comparatively</i> insignificant in point of value, and
much less frequently called for in the services of the Levitical ritual.
For instance, in Numbers xxviii, xxix, the daily offering was a
burnt-offering of a he-lamb morning and evening, with the corresponding
accompaniments of fine flour mingled with oil, and a drink-offering of
wine. On the Sabbath Day an additional burnt-offering of two lambs with
their meat-offering and drink-offering was required. At the time of the
new moon, the additional offering was of two bullocks, one ram, and
seven lambs, with their meat and drink-offerings, for a burnt-offering,
while one he-goat sufficed for a sin-offering. The same offerings were
offered at the Feasts of Passover and<span class='pagenum'><a name="page37" id="page37">[Pg 37]</a></span> Pentecost. On several other
occasions the offerings were nearly of the same proportions; while
during the Feast of Tabernacles the offerings commenced with thirteen
bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs for a burnt-offering to one
he-goat for a sin-offering.</p>

<p>The same disproportion of number and value may be noticed on many
occasions between the sin-offering and the peace offering. A striking
example of this was the sacrifice of peace-offerings made by Solomon on
the dedication of the temple to the number of 22,000 oxen, and 120,000
sheep.</p>

<p>We cannot but see that teaching of the most important character is to be
gathered from these facts; and is it not clear that while the need of
forgiveness and cleansing is never to be lost sight of, it is <i>not</i>
intended that a sense of the presence and defilement of sin should be<span class='pagenum'><a name="page38" id="page38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
the prominent feature of the service of <span class="smcap">God</span>? On the great Day of
Atonement Israel's sin was confessed <i>and put away</i>; and thenceforward
the daily and the Sabbath worship was that of whole burnt-offering. At
the special festivals a he-goat was sacrificed for sin; but, as we have
seen, the burnt-offerings, which speak of acceptance by, and devotion
to, <span class="smcap">God</span> were the principal features. It is the purpose of <span class="smcap">God</span> that in
the present dispensation His people should have and enjoy <i>full
assurance</i> of salvation through the offering of <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span> once for
all; and more than this, should know that He who "died for their
offences, and was raised again for their justification," henceforth
"liveth unto <span class="smcap">God</span>;" <i>in order</i> that His people may likewise "reckon
themselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto <span class="smcap">God</span>, in <span class="smcap">Jesus<span class='pagenum'><a name="page39" id="page39">[Pg 39]</a></span></span>
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> our <span class="smcap">Lord</span>." In <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span> there is no condemnation. In <span class="smcap">Jesus
Christ</span>, the law of the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span> of life hath set me "free from the law of
sin and of death." By the will of <span class="smcap">God</span> "we are sanctified, through the
offering of the body of <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span> once for all;" and by "that one
offering He hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified."</p>

<h3>THE BURNT-OFFERING.</h3>

<p>To return to the order of enumeration: the burnt-offering is always
mentioned first, because it is the highest in character, and gave most
pleasure to <span class="smcap">God</span>. It was wholly the <span class="smcap">Lord's</span>; no part of it was eaten by
the priest who offered it, nor by the offerer who presented it, it was
all and only for <span class="smcap">God's</span> satisfaction. When Noah offered his
burnt-offering, the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> smelled a<span class='pagenum'><a name="page40" id="page40">[Pg 40]</a></span> sweet savour, and blessed him and
his posterity. When Abraham in purpose offered up his son Isaac, <span class="smcap">God</span>
said, "By myself have I sworn, saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, for because thou hast
done this thing, ... that in blessing I will bless thee, and in
multiplying I will multiply thy seed; ... and thy seed shall possess the
gate of his enemies; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth
be blessed."</p>

<p>The burnt-offering tells us of the perfect and accepted righteousness of
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>, in virtue of which the imperfect believer and his imperfect
service are accepted by <span class="smcap">God</span>. But it also reminds the believer of his
privilege to <i>surrender himself</i> as a living sacrifice, holy and
acceptable unto <span class="smcap">God</span>, which is to be the reasonable (intelligent) service
(that is, ritual or worship) of each day and hour.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page41" id="page41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE SIN-OFFERING AND THE PEACE-OFFERING.</h3>

<p>The sin-offering, as its name indicates, recognized the offerer as
guilty and defiled, but obtaining forgiveness and cleansing through the
death of the victim in his stead. We see <span class="smcap">Christ</span> as our sin-offering in
Isa. liii. 4-10. But guilt removed still leaves the believer needing the
imputed righteousness of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, and acceptance before <span class="smcap">God</span>, which are
the aspects of <span class="smcap">Christ's</span> death foreshadowed, as we have seen by the
burnt-offering.</p>

<p>Lastly, the peace-offering&mdash;part of which was consumed on the altar,
while part was the portion of the priest, and the remainder furnished a
feast to the offerer and his friends&mdash;shows us <span class="smcap">God</span> and man feasting
together on the perfect work of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>. He that<span class='pagenum'><a name="page42" id="page42">[Pg 42]</a></span> sanctifieth and those
who are sanctified, find their full satisfaction in Him, and in Him
alone. He has made peace by the blood of His cross. He has given us His
own peace. We are called to let His peace <i>rule</i> in our hearts. And if
we will but bring our burdens and cares to Him, we are promised that the
peace of <span class="smcap">God</span> shall guard and garrison our hearts and thoughts in <span class="smcap">Christ</span>
<span class="smcap">Jesus</span>!</p>

<h2>PART II.</h2>

<h2>The Blessing of <span class="smcap">God</span>.</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">Numb. vi. 22-27.</span></h2>

<p>We have already seen the grace of <span class="smcap">God</span> making provision that His people,
who had lost the privilege of priestly service, might draw near to Him
by Nazarite separation and consecration. And not as the offence was the
free gift: those who had forfeited the privilege of priestly service
were the males only, but women and even children might be Nazarites;
whosoever desired was free to come, and thus draw near to <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>

<p>We now come to the concluding verses of Numb. vi, and see in them one of
the fullest forms of benediction<span class='pagenum'><a name="page44" id="page44">[Pg 44]</a></span> to be found in the whole Word of <span class="smcap">God</span>.
The thought naturally arises,</p>

<h3>WHY IS IT FOUND HERE?</h3>

<p>And the reply is twofold. There is the Divine side. Flowing from <span class="smcap">God's</span>
heart of love first came the <i>privilege</i> of Nazarite consecration; and
then, by the <i>act</i> of consecration, His loving heart is so gladdened
that it further overflows in these rich benedictions.</p>

<p>Looking, on the other hand, at the human side, we may learn that the
soul which is fully consecrated <i>always</i> receives the blessing of <span class="smcap">God</span>.
Where that blessing is not enjoyed, there is always something unreal or
defective in the consecration. It may be that we have separated
ourselves to carry out <i>our own will, or thought, or plan of service</i>,
instead of surrendering our<span class='pagenum'><a name="page45" id="page45">[Pg 45]</a></span>selves and <i>our</i> will, to learn and to do
<i>His</i> will. But it is real consecration <i>to GOD</i> that puts us into the
position in which He can pour out His richest blessings upon us.</p>

<p>The prodigal was a son of the father all the time; but when he preferred
<i>his</i> will to the will of his father, <i>his</i> way to the way of his
father, <i>his</i> management of his share in the property to his father's
management, it issued but in ruin and misery&mdash;in hunger and nakedness
and shame. The fact that he was a son was of no avail to him in the "far
country," in the place of self-will and self-management. But as soon as
he arose, and with true repentance and submission came back to the
father's house, willing to serve, and to do his father's will, he found
himself restored to his father's heart, and to all the privileges of
sonship: the fatted calf<span class='pagenum'><a name="page46" id="page46">[Pg 46]</a></span> was killed, the best robe was put upon him,
once more he had shoes on his feet and a ring on his hand, and joy and
gladness filled the home.</p>

<p>How many Christians there are who, in their self-will and attempted
self-management, find themselves day by day full of sorrow, or full of
care. Trying to keep themselves they are not kept; trying to be happy
they are often unhappy; trying to succeed they fail; and they can but
confess that their life is very different from that ideal life described
in Ps. lxxxix. 15-18:</p>

<table class="center" summary="poetry">
<tr>
<td>
<p>"Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound:<br />
They shall walk, O <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, in the light of Thy countenance.<br />
In Thy Name shall they rejoice all the day:<br />
And in Thy righteousness shall they be exalted.<br />
For Thou art the glory of their strength;<br />
And in Thy favour our horn shall be exalted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="page47" id="page47">[Pg 47]</a></span><br />
And in Thy favour our horn shall be exalted.<br />
For the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is our defence;<br />
And the <span class="smcap">Holy</span> <span class="smcap">One</span> of Israel is our <span class="smcap">King</span>."</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Instead of this many practically know very little of peace "which
passeth all understanding," of joy that is literally "unspeakable";
adjectives far more moderate would be found strong enough to express all
<i>they</i> know of oft-troubled peace and intermittent satisfaction and
happiness. Many there are who fail to see that there can be but one
lord, and that those who do not make <span class="smcap">God</span> <i>Lord of all</i> do not make Him
<i>Lord at all</i>. The slightest reservation in our consecration shows that
we hold ourselves <i>as our own</i>, and consequently at liberty to give Him
as much or as little as we think fit. If we recognize Him as <span class="smcap">Lord</span> and
<span class="smcap">Master</span>, we have nothing to withhold, and nothing of our own, for we, and
all we have, are already His. But then, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="page48" id="page48">[Pg 48]</a></span> return, all He has, and all
He is, become ours. Oh! blessed <span class="smcap">Portion</span>! Who would not wish henceforth
to have no private property in himself&mdash;in his members&mdash;in his
possessions&mdash;in his family&mdash;in his affections; but, in fullest
consecration, to acknowledge and recognize <span class="smcap">God's</span> right and to be no
longer a robber of <span class="smcap">God</span>?</p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>"And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto Aaron and unto his
sons, saying, On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel ... And
they shall put My Name upon the children of Israel; and I will bless
them."</i></p>

<p>Here we have the blessing that <span class="smcap">God</span> <i>delights</i> to give to those who have
dedicated themselves and their all to Him. Before considering it in
detail, let us notice, first, how spontaneous and unsought is this
blessing from <span class="smcap">God</span>&mdash;the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> <i>commanded</i> Aaron and his<span class='pagenum'><a name="page49" id="page49">[Pg 49]</a></span> sons to bless
Israel, to put His Name upon them; and declared His own unalterable
purpose, "I <i>will</i> bless them." And then, let us ask ourselves the
question, what is</p>

<h3>THE REAL MEANING OF BLESSING?</h3>

<p>We frequently use the word so vaguely as to lose much of its
preciousness, and to overlook the primary meaning in some of its
secondary significations. For instance, we use it frequently as a
synonym of praise, and in speaking of blessing <span class="smcap">God</span>, we think of praising
Him. But blessing does not merely mean praise, for <span class="smcap">God</span> blesses us.
Again, sometimes we use it for some gracious gift, as when we speak of
the blessing of peace or of plenty. But blessing does not only signify
gift, for when we bless <span class="smcap">God</span> we do not give to Him peace<span class='pagenum'><a name="page50" id="page50">[Pg 50]</a></span> or plenty.
Blessing is <i>the moving of the heart towards an object of affection and
complacency</i>. The out-going of the heart is naturally <i>accompanied</i> by
gift or ascription, as the case may be. When our hearts bless the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
we sing a song of praise to Him for the great love wherewith He hath
loved us; but the blessing is not the song&mdash;it is the feeling that
prompts it. When the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> blesses His people with peace and plenty, it
is His open Heart that moves His loving Hand.</p>

<p>Again, blessing is always accompanied with joy; it <i>is</i> a joy, and it
<i>gives</i> joy, both to the giver and the receiver. A little child playing
with his toys may be both happy and satisfied. But it hears the mother's
footsteps, it sees the mother open the door, and instantly the toys are
dropped and forgotten; the little arms are stretched <span class='pagenum'><a name="page51" id="page51">[Pg 51]</a></span>out, and the
little feet are running to meet the welcome mother. Nor is this all; the
great, motherly arms are as quickly stretched forth towards the child,
and with longer steps the mother hastens to meet the little one, and
clasps it to her bosom, the loving little arms entwining themselves
around her neck.</p>

<p>But whose heart is the more glad? The little one's heart is <i>full</i>; and
the mother's heart is also <i>full</i>; but her capacity is greater, and so
her joy is deeper. And is not this true of our <span class="smcap">Heavenly Father</span>? When His
heart blesses ours, and ours blesses <span class="smcap">Him</span>, <i>we</i> are full of joy; but His
heart is infinitely greater than ours, and His joy in His people as far
exceeds all their joy in Him, as the infinite exceeds the finite.</p>

<p>Let us always remember in connection with blessing that the deep
heart-feeling is the primary thought.<span class='pagenum'><a name="page52" id="page52">[Pg 52]</a></span> "Bless the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, O my <i>soul</i>; and
all that is <i>within me</i>, bless His holy Name." The praise of the lip may
be insincere; the blessing of the heart cannot be.</p>


<h3>THE THREE-FOLD BENEDICTION: verses 24-26.</h3>

<p class="blockquot"><i>"The LORD bless thee, and keep thee:</i></p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>"The LORD make His face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto
thee:</i></p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>"The LORD lift up His countenance upon thee, and give thee
peace.</i>"</p>

<p>We have dwelt upon the meaning of blessing&mdash;the moving of the heart
towards an object of affection and complacency, and noticed that this is
naturally accompanied by gift or ascription, as the case may be. When
love overflows, loving words, loving embraces, or loving gifts
instinctively follow.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page53" id="page53">[Pg 53]</a></span>In the light of the fuller revelation of the New Testament we can
scarcely fail to see in this three-fold benediction the overflow in
blessing of the <span class="smcap">Father</span>, of the <span class="smcap">Son</span>, and of the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span>; and we may read
it as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="smcap">"Jehovah, the Father, bless thee, and keep thee:</p>

<p class="smcap">"Jehovah, the Son, the Bridegroom, make His face shine upon thee,
and be gracious unto thee:</p>

<p class="smcap">"Jehovah, the Spirit, lift up His countenance upon thee, and give
thee peace."</p></div>

<p>So read, we see in these words fuller beauty and appropriateness. Let us
now notice the first clause in particular.</p>

<h3>THE BLESSING OF THE FATHER.</h3>

<p>Considered as a father's blessing could anything be more appropriate
than "The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> bless thee, and keep<span class='pagenum'><a name="page54" id="page54">[Pg 54]</a></span> thee"? Is not this just what every
loving father seeks to do&mdash;to bless and keep his children? He does not
find it an unwelcome task, but his greatest delight. Offer to relieve
him of the responsibility and to adopt his child, and see what his reply
will be! Nor may we confine ourselves to paternal love in thinking of
this subject; but rather take it as parental love, embracing also the
love of the mother, for "Thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, ... As one whom his mother
comforteth, so will I comfort you." We all know how the mother-love
delights to lavish itself on the objects of its care. With a patience
that never tires, and an endurance almost inexhaustible, and a care all
but unlimited, how often has the mother sacrificed her very life for the
welfare of her babe. But strong as is a mother's love, it <i>may</i> fail;
<span class="smcap">God's</span> love<span class='pagenum'><a name="page55" id="page55">[Pg 55]</a></span> <i>never</i>. "Can a woman forget her suckling child that she
should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget,
yet will I not forget thee."</p>

<p>It was one of the objects of our <span class="smcap">Saviour's</span> mission to reveal to us that,
in <span class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span>, <span class="smcap">God</span> is also our <span class="smcap">Father</span>. How He delighted in bringing
out this precious truth the Sermon on the Mount bears witness: "Glorify
your Father." "Love ... bless ... do good, that ye may be the children
of your <span class="smcap">Father</span>." Be "perfect, even as your <span class="smcap">Father</span>." "Thy <span class="smcap">Father</span> ...
seeth." "Your <span class="smcap">Father</span> knoweth," etc., etc. And well may our hearts rest
in the thought which so satisfied His heart, that <span class="smcap">God</span> is indeed our
<span class="smcap">Father</span>.</p>

<p>And what a glorious <span class="smcap">Father</span> He is! the source of all true fatherhood and<span class='pagenum'><a name="page56" id="page56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
motherhood. We have often walked in the fields in the early morning, and
have noticed how the rising sun has turned each dewdrop into a
glittering gem; one ray of its own bright light makes a little sun of
each of the million drops that hang from the pendent leaflets and
sparkle everywhere. But it is helpful to remember that the glorious orb
itself contains infinitely more light than all the dewdrops ever did or
ever will reflect. And so of our heavenly <span class="smcap">Father</span>: Himself the great
Source of all that is noble and true, of all that ever has been loving
and trust-worthy&mdash;each beautiful trait of each beautiful character is
but the dim reflection of some ray of His own great perfection. And the
sum-total of all human goodness, and tenderness, and love is but as the
dewdrops to the sun. How blessed then to confide in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="page57" id="page57">[Pg 57]</a></span> infinite and
changeless love of such a <span class="smcap">Father</span>&mdash;our <span class="smcap">Father</span> in heaven!</p>

<p>How safe too! "There is none like unto the <span class="smcap">God</span> of Jeshurun, who rideth
upon the heaven in thy help, and in His excellency on the sky. The
eternal <span class="smcap">God</span> is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms."
Ofttimes where the love of earthly parents has not failed, yet have they
been powerless to bless and to keep. The cruel tyrant has tortured the
parent in torturing the child; while there has been no power to deliver.
And in the presence of human want or suffering how impotent has the
strongest human love oft proved to be! Not so the love of our heavenly
<span class="smcap">Father</span>: His resources and His power are as inexhaustible as His love;
and they are blest and kept indeed whom He deigns to bless and keep.</p>

<p>May we not add "they only"? The<span class='pagenum'><a name="page58" id="page58">[Pg 58]</a></span> foolish prodigal imagines that he can
secure greater happiness for himself when no longer curbed by his
father's presence and will; such always come to want, and, alas! do not
always return quickly to the home where reconciliation and blessing
alone are to be found. He is poorly kept who tries to keep himself; and
though the pleasures of sin may for a season gratify, they can never
satisfy!<a name="FNanchor_A_2" id="FNanchor_A_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_2" class="fnanchor">B</a></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Jehovah</span>, the <span class="smcap">Father</span>, bless <i>thee</i>, and keep <i>thee</i>." It is an
individual blessing: and it includes every form of blessing, temporal as
well as spiritual <span class='pagenum'><a name="page59" id="page59">[Pg 59]</a></span>&mdash;"My <span class="smcap">God</span> shall supply all your need"; and this "according to His
riches in glory in <span class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span>," not according to our consciousness of
need. He is <i>able</i> to bless, able to make all grace abound&mdash;to so
wonderfully abound towards us, that we always having all sufficiency in
all things, may abound to every good work: He is able to keep&mdash;to keep
us from falling, to keep us from all evil. And not only is He able, but
He has already "blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
things in <span class="smcap">Christ</span>," and He wants us, His children, to know and to enjoy
the love that is the source of all blessing: the love that can never by
finite words express its fulness: the love that eternal ages will never
exhaust!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page60" id="page60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE SECOND PERSON OF THE TRINITY.</h3>

<p>The second clause of the blessing is the blessing of the <span class="smcap">Son</span>, which is
not less full and appropriate. Through eternal ages the <span class="smcap">Son</span> of <span class="smcap">God</span>, He
became, in the fulness of time, the <span class="smcap">Son</span> of Man. The Brightness of His
<span class="smcap">Father's</span> glory, the <span class="smcap">Sun</span> of Righteousness, He came to manifest, as well
as to speak of, the <span class="smcap">Father's</span> love. He became the <span class="smcap">Light</span> of the world, as
well as the <span class="smcap">Lamb</span> of <span class="smcap">God</span>; but in each aspect doing the will, as well as
the work of <span class="smcap">God</span>, He thus revealed the wondrous love and grace of the
<span class="smcap">Father</span>, and His own perfect Sonship. The <span class="smcap">Father's</span> will included <span class="smcap">Christ's</span>
glad reception of all who come to Him, His meeting all their
need&mdash;saving, sanctifying, satisfying, keeping, raising up at the last
day&mdash;His giving<span class='pagenum'><a name="page61" id="page61">[Pg 61]</a></span> Himself for, and giving Himself to, all those given to
Him of the <span class="smcap">Father</span>.</p>

<p>He is indeed a wonderful Saviour! What light the incarnate <span class="smcap">Word</span> of <span class="smcap">God</span>
(Who is Light) has thrown on the written Word of <span class="smcap">God</span>! The law in its
legal requirements He has fulfilled, bringing in everlasting
righteousness, which is imputed to all those who are indeed in Him. He
has also fulfilled the Law in its manifold typical aspects&mdash;Himself the
Temple, the Priest, and the Sacrifice; Himself the Altar, the Offerer,
and the Victim; Himself the Lamp, and the Priestly Trimmer of the lamps
(as He is also the whole Vine, and yet the Life of each individual
branch of the Vine). Time would fail us to enumerate the various objects
and acts of typical service which were all fulfilled in Him. He too is
the <span class="smcap">Bridegroom</span>, from whose<span class='pagenum'><a name="page62" id="page62">[Pg 62]</a></span> wounded side the Bride is being formed; and
He is waiting for His Bride, who will soon be caught up to meet Him in
the air. The true <span class="smcap">Solomon</span> is He whose glory we shall share, and not only
so, but whose presence will be the ever-satisfying portion of His chosen
Bride.</p>

The <span class="smcap">Lamb</span> is all the glory of Immanuel's land.</p>
</td>

</table>

<p>May the <span class="smcap">Holy Spirit</span> give us more and more to realize the practical
bearing of all that is thus revealed of the glory of the Person, and the
fulness of the work of our <span class="smcap">Saviour</span> and <span class="smcap">King</span>!</p>

<h3>THE BLESSING OF THE SON AND BRIDEGROOM.</h3>

<p class="blockquot"><span class="smcap">Jehovah, the Son, make His face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto
Thee.</span></p>

<p>The first clause of the three-fold blessing told of the going out of the
heart of the invisible <span class="smcap">Father</span>; now, when we come to the blessing of the
<span class="smcap">Son</span>, we read, "The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> <i>make his face shine</i> upon thee," or, in other
words, make visibly <i>manifest</i> His favour towards thee. The <span class="smcap">Son</span> of <span class="smcap">God</span>
is the <span class="smcap">Kinsman</span> who has the right to redeem, the <span class="smcap">Friend</span> who sticketh
closer than a brother, the <span class="smcap">One</span> who has come, not only to be the <span class="smcap">Light</span> of
the world, but in an especial sense to be the <span class="smcap">Light</span> of His own redeemed
ones.</p>

<p>There was no need in Israel of a kinsman-redeemer in times of
pros<span class='pagenum'><a name="page64" id="page64">[Pg 64]</a></span>perity; but when bereavement and poverty afforded opportunity to
the creditors to seize the possession, then a kind and wealthy
kinsman-redeemer was a blessing indeed. We are reminded of the beautiful
history of Ruth: how sweetly the gracious words of Boaz fell on the ear
of the young stranger, and what blessing that kinsman brought into her
heart and life! The <span class="smcap">Friend</span> that sticketh closer than a brother is
precious at all times, but never so valued as in times of adversity; and
the very expression, "<span class="smcap">The Light</span> of the world," tells us of the darkness
that sin has brought in&mdash;a darkness, alas! not only around, but also
within. The shining of the face of <span class="smcap">Jehovah</span>, the <span class="smcap">Son</span>, dispels the
darkness and the gloom, manifests the presence of the <span class="smcap">Friend</span> in need,
and shows us the <span class="smcap">Redeemer</span>, who not only<span class='pagenum'><a name="page65" id="page65">[Pg 65]</a></span> delivers, but becomes the
<span class="smcap">Bridegroom</span> of the soul.</p>

<p>"Make His <i>face</i> shine upon thee." The face is perhaps the most
wonderful part of the wonderful human body. Of all the faces that <span class="smcap">God</span>
has made no two are exactly alike, even when quiescent; and though we do
occasionally meet with those that bear a very close resemblance,
intimate friends, who know the play of the countenance, never mistake.
And why is this? Because <span class="smcap">God</span> has so ordered it, that the face shall
<i>reveal</i> the character and feelings of the individual. And it is the
purpose of <span class="smcap">God</span> that the heart of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> shall be revealed to His people.
That heart might have been full of love, and we might never have known
it; but it is the will of <span class="smcap">God</span> that "the light of the knowledge of the
glory of <span class="smcap">God</span>" should be<span class='pagenum'><a name="page66" id="page66">[Pg 66]</a></span> <i>revealed</i> to us "in the face of <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>."</p>

<p>How well we know in actual life what the light of the countenance means!
How the mother's smile brings light and gladness into the heart of the
child! How the welcoming look of a friend is at once understood! In
Daniel ix. 16, 17, the prophet prays, "O Lord ... I beseech Thee, let
Thine anger and Thy fury be turned away from Thy city, Jerusalem; ...
and cause Thy face to shine upon Thy sanctuary that is desolate." Where
there is the shining of the face we know there is more than forgiveness;
there is favour and complacence. In the thrice-offered prayer of Psalm
lxxx, "Cause Thy face to shine, and we shall be saved," the salvation of
Israel is counted upon as the result; and in Psalm lxvii, we find that
the shining<span class='pagenum'><a name="page67" id="page67">[Pg 67]</a></span> of <span class="smcap">God's</span> face upon His people is further to issue in His
way being "known upon earth, His saving health among all nations."</p>

<p>It is, however, when we consider Him in the relationship of <span class="smcap">Bridegroom</span>
and <span class="smcap">King</span> that the tenderness and preciousness of this blessing are most
fully seen. A truly royal <span class="smcap">Bridegroom</span>: "in His favour is life," and to
Him we can approach at all times, without any fear that He will hide His
countenance, or that He will not hold out to us the golden sceptre.
Queen Esther might tremble for the result of her boldness, but our <span class="smcap">King</span>
ever welcomes the approach of His Bride.</p>

<p>When her heart cries out, "Let him kiss me with the kisses of His
mouth," He is ever ready to bring her into His chambers; indeed it is
often the <span class="smcap">Bridegroom</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="page68" id="page68">[Pg 68]</a></span> who has to allure the Bride,<a name="FNanchor_A_3" id="FNanchor_A_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_3" class="fnanchor">C</a> rather than the
Bride who has to seek the favour of the <span class="smcap">Bridegroom</span>. It is only when she
has treated him with neglect or disobedience that she finds herself in
darkness. And what is not His favour to a loyal and true-hearted Bride!
To a subject, the favour of the <span class="smcap">King</span> is "as dew upon the grass," but to
a bride is it not everything? "JEHOVAH, the <span class="smcap">Bridegroom</span>, make His face
shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee!"</p>

<p>What a wonderful view of the light of His countenance the favoured
disciples must have had, who were witnesses of His transfiguration: we
are told that His face did shine as the sun. To the proto-martyr Stephen
the <span class='pagenum'><a name="page69" id="page69">[Pg 69]</a></span>heavens were opened, and the face of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shone upon him: and when
he saw Him he became so like Him, that his dying utterances corresponded
with those of his <span class="smcap">Lord</span> on the Cross. When Saul, likewise, saw the glory
of his risen <span class="smcap">Saviour</span>, on the way to Damascus, the vision at midday was
of a light above the brightness of the sun shining round about him; and
the effect of that heavenly vision changed the whole current of his
life, making him a follower of the <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, who pleased not Himself, and
making the spirit manifested in his first cry, "<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, what wilt <i>Thou</i>
have me to do?" the spirit of his life ever after. And so when the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
makes the light of His countenance to shine upon any of His people, in
the measure in which with unveiled face they discern the beauty of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, there is a moral and pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="page70" id="page70">[Pg 70]</a></span>gressive change into His likeness, the
work of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span>.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_3" id="Footnote_A_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_3"><span class="label">C</span></a> "Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away."&mdash;Cant. ii.
10; "Come with Me from Lebanon, My spouse."&mdash;Cant. iv. 8.</p></div>

<h3>THE LORD, THE SPIRIT.</h3>

<p>We have considered the bountiful overflow of the <span class="smcap">Father's</span> love; and our
hearts have burned within us as we dwelt upon and felt the glow of the
love of the <span class="smcap">Son</span>. Now, as we think of the blessing of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, the
<span class="smcap">Spirit</span>, may He reveal Himself to us through these holy Words, which were
written by His inspiration and which can never be fully understood and
enjoyed save by His own illumination. The Bible is a supernatural book,
a divine revelation: the <span class="smcap">Holy Spirit</span> is the supernatural, the divine
<span class="smcap">Guide</span> to its meaning. From the "wise and prudent" its teachings are
hidden;&mdash;hence the questionings of some of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="page71" id="page71">[Pg 71]</a></span> learned only confirm its
truth; but to "babes"&mdash;to all those, whether learned or unlearned, in
whom the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span> has wrought the child-like spirit, it is an opened
book: they love it, and feast upon it, and grow thereby.</p>

<p>It is very important to have clear thoughts about the third person of
the Trinity. Many Christians fail in this respect, and lose much in
consequence. He has as distinct personality as has the <span class="smcap">Son</span> of <span class="smcap">God</span>; and
we must not think or speak of Him vaguely, as though He were an
influence merely and not a person. Our <span class="smcap">Saviour</span> teaches us that <i>we</i>
should <i>know</i> Him, "for He abideth with you, and shall be in you." But
are there not many of the <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> people to whom He is not yet "a living,
bright Reality"?</p>

<p>So important are the presence and<span class='pagenum'><a name="page72" id="page72">[Pg 72]</a></span> the work of the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>, that our
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> assured His disciples that it was expedient for them that <i>He</i>
should go away, in order that the <span class="smcap">Comforter</span> should come. And we see the
mighty change that was wrought in the disciples when the outpouring of
the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span> actually took place at Pentecost. The timid became
courageous; the scattered and persecuted disciples went everywhere
preaching the Word; the <span class="smcap">Holy Spirit</span> wrought conviction of sin, and
revealed the risen <span class="smcap">Saviour</span> as the object of faith; and many were added
to the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. The same <span class="smcap">Spirit</span> is still present with us; may we too be
filled, and largely used as channels of blessing.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page73" id="page73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE BLESSING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.</h3>

<p class="blockquot"><span class="smcap">"Jehovah, the Spirit, lift up His countenance upon thee, and give thee
peace."</span></p>

<p>The blessing of the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span> is essential to the completeness of the
benediction. We are struck, however, with the similarity of this
blessing to that which precedes it; nor is the similarity surprising.
For, as the <span class="smcap">Son</span> came to reveal the <span class="smcap">Father</span>, so the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span> has come to
reveal the <span class="smcap">Son</span>. <span class="smcap">Christ</span> was a true <span class="smcap">Comforter</span>; but His personal work on
earth being finished, He ascended on high to minister for His people as
their <span class="smcap">High Priest</span> in the presence of <span class="smcap">God</span>. The <span class="smcap">Holy Spirit</span> is the other
<span class="smcap">Comforter</span>, sent by the <span class="smcap">Father</span> in <span class="smcap">Christ's</span> name, that He might abide with
the Church for ever. <span class="smcap">Christ</span> is the indwelling <span class="smcap">Saviour</span>: <span class='pagenum'><a name="page74" id="page74">[Pg 74]</a></span>the <span class="smcap">Holy Spirit</span>
the indwelling <span class="smcap">Comforter</span>. On whomsoever <span class="smcap">Christ</span> makes His face to shine,
the <span class="smcap">Holy Spirit</span> will surely lift up</p>

<h3>HIS COUNTENANCE.</h3>

<p>"Lift up His <i>countenance</i> upon thee." We have already dwelt on the
significance of the face or countenance (the same original word) as
revealing the emotions of the heart. We see from these words that it is
the purpose of <span class="smcap">God</span> that the presence and the love of the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span> should
be made known to those in whom He dwells. When He lifts up His
countenance upon us, we walk in conscious security and freedom; but if
the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span> be grieved, the light of His countenance is hidden from us,
and we walk in darkness. And, oh, how dangerous is<span class='pagenum'><a name="page75" id="page75">[Pg 75]</a></span> this walking in
darkness, how surely we shall wander from the way, and fall into some of
the snares of the devil! There is only one safe course, to confess the
sin that has grieved Him, and take no rest till communion is restored:
this may always be done most easily by <i>immediate</i> confession and
turning to Him, who is our Advocate with the <span class="smcap">Father</span>, and whose shed
blood cleanses from all sin. When sin is put away the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span> again lifts
up His countenance upon us, and peace fills the heart.</p>

<h3>THE PEACE OF THE SPIRIT.</h3>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>, when on earth, said, "Peace I leave with you, My peace I
give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your
heart be troubled, neither let<span class='pagenum'><a name="page76" id="page76">[Pg 76]</a></span> it be afraid." But here it is the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span>
who is spoken of as bestowing peace: why is this? Because the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span> of
<span class="smcap">God</span> makes real things real to <i>us</i>, and enables us practically to enjoy
the blessings procured for us by the death and resurrection and priestly
ministry of the <span class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>. Many a believer to whom <span class="smcap">Christ</span> has left
peace, knows little of it; but those who are filled with the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span> are
filled with peace. They have peace with <span class="smcap">God</span>; they have also heart-peace
in the midst of conflict and turmoil; and the peace of <span class="smcap">God</span>, which
passeth all understanding, guards their hearts and thoughts. The fruit
of the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span> is love, joy, peace.</p>

<p>Are <i>we</i> practically enjoying this blessing, and experiencing this peace
which passes all understanding? Are we <i>finding</i> that when He makes
quietness, none can make trouble? And if<span class='pagenum'><a name="page77" id="page77">[Pg 77]</a></span> not, what is the hindrance? Is
there any known sin unconfessed, or not put away? Has wrong been done,
and restitution to the extent of our ability not been made? Is there any
matter in which <span class="smcap">God</span> has a controversy with us? Or are we indulging
ourselves in anything about which we have doubt? Are we withholding
anything from <span class="smcap">God</span> which is His due&mdash;ourselves, our property, our
children; or, it may be, our testimony? Or, if none of these things are
hindering us, are we failing to <i>accept</i>, by faith, the filling of the
<span class="smcap">Spirit</span>; perhaps only asking, but not receiving also? Is it that we are
neglecting the prayerful study of <span class="smcap">God's</span> Word, and thus grieving the
<span class="smcap">Spirit</span> by whom it was inspired? Paul asked <span class="smcap">God</span> to give the Ephesian
Christians the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span> of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>, that they might<span class='pagenum'><a name="page78" id="page78">[Pg 78]</a></span> know the hope of His calling and the exceeding
greatness of His power toward them <i>that believe</i>. We do well to note
the words "that believe," for unbelief lies at the root of every form of
hindrance.</p>

<p>As the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span> reveals <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, so does <span class="smcap">Christ</span> bestow the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span>; and by
faith in <span class="smcap">Christ</span> and in His Word we appropriate the gift. We shall never
forget the blessing we received through the words, in John iv. 14,
"Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him</p>

<p class="center">SHALL NEVER THIRST,"</p>

<p>nearly thirty years ago. As we realized that <span class="smcap">Christ</span> literally meant what
He said&mdash;that "shall" meant shall, and "never" meant never, and "thirst"
meant thirst&mdash;our heart overflowed<span class='pagenum'><a name="page79" id="page79">[Pg 79]</a></span> with joy as we accepted the gift.
Oh, the thirst with which we had sat down, but oh, the joy with which we
sprang from our seat, praising the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> that the thirsting days were all
past, and past for ever! For, as our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> continues, "the water that I
shall give him shall be <i>in him</i> a well of water, springing
up&mdash;overflowing&mdash;unto everlasting life." Perhaps, however, we should
draw attention to the words of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, "whosoever drinketh"; not
drank&mdash;once for all&mdash;but "drinketh," that is habitually: as in chap.
vii. 38, 39, where, after promising that out of him "shall flow rivers
of living water," it is significally added, "this spake He of the
<span class="smcap">Spirit</span>, which they that believe"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, keep believing&mdash;should
receive.</p>

<p>Is it not sad that so free a gift should be so little esteemed, so often
neither enjoyed nor sought after? It<span class='pagenum'><a name="page80" id="page80">[Pg 80]</a></span> is intended for <i>each one</i> of
us&mdash;"lift up His countenance upon <i>thee</i>, and give <i>thee</i> peace." Would
that each reader would accept the gift <i>now</i>, and evermore enjoy it, to
the glory of <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>

<h3>SEALING WITH THE NAME OF GOD: verse 27.</h3>

<p class="blockquot"><i>"And they shall put My Name upon the children of Israel; and I will
bless them."</i></p>

<p>With these words this wonderful chapter closes, and the great object of
<span class="smcap">God</span> in bestowing His blessing upon His people is revealed: "They shall
put <i>My Name</i> upon the children of Israel," or, in other words, shall
cause them not only to become the people of <span class="smcap">God</span>, but also to become
manifestly such.</p>

<p>In olden time names were not meaningless, but were descriptive of<span class='pagenum'><a name="page81" id="page81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
character or relationship. The various names of <span class="smcap">God</span> are all full of
significance, and each is always used designedly in the Bible: failing
to recognize this, learned, but spiritually-ignorant men have imagined
the Old Testament writings to have been mere compilations from the works
of different authors, and have failed to see the beautiful
appropriateness of the various names of <span class="smcap">God</span> as they are used in
different connections.</p>

<p>In the preceding benediction the thrice repeated Name of <span class="smcap">Jehovah</span> has
revealed to us the triune <span class="smcap">God</span> in His gracious relations with His
redeemed people, and has also reminded us that in these relationships He
is the unchanging One, the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever; for all
this is contained in the Name <span class="smcap">Jehovah</span>. And thus the expression, "They
shall put<span class='pagenum'><a name="page82" id="page82">[Pg 82]</a></span> <i>My Name</i> upon the children of Israel," implies the purpose
of <span class="smcap">God</span> that in His people should be manifested, not only the <i>beauties</i>
of His Divine character, but also the <i>unchanging relationship</i> in which
they stand to Him. Israel of old was, and still is, <span class="smcap">God's</span> witness in the
world. In all their unfaithfulness, their very existence as a separate
people is a standing miracle, witnessing to the truth of prophecy. But
had they been faithful they would have been much more than this; for the
beauty of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> their <span class="smcap">God</span> would have been upon them; and receiving
His blessing themselves, they would have become a blessing to the world.
We who are now the children of <span class="smcap">God</span>&mdash;Christians upon whom the Name of
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> has been called&mdash;are intended to be witnesses for our <span class="smcap">Master</span>, and
to show forth the beauties of Him who has "called us by<span class='pagenum'><a name="page83" id="page83">[Pg 83]</a></span> His own glory
and virtue." (2 Peter i. 3.&mdash;R.V.)</p>

<p>There is an interesting parallelism between the passage we are
considering and the commission given by our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> to His people to
disciple all nations, baptizing them into the <i>Name</i> of the <span class="smcap">Father</span>, the
<span class="smcap">Son</span>, and the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>. True Christians are <i>kept</i> by the power of <span class="smcap">God</span>
("the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> bless thee and <i>keep thee</i>"), in the grace which is in <span class="smcap">Christ
Jesus</span> ("the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> make His face shine upon thee, and be <i>gracious unto
thee</i>"), and receive the illumination of the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span> ("the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> <i>lift
up His countenance upon thee</i>"), in order that <i>they</i> may shine as
lights in the world, and become living epistles, known and read of all
men.</p>

<p>It is deeply interesting also to connect the sealing of this passage
with<span class='pagenum'><a name="page84" id="page84">[Pg 84]</a></span> that of Rev. vii and xiv. In the former passage (Rev. vii. 1-3) we
see the powers to whom the plagues are committed restrained until the
sealing of the servants of <span class="smcap">God</span> is completed. The hundred and forty and
four thousand are all sealed&mdash;a mystical and symbolical number of the
mystical and symbolical Israel, not of Israel according to the flesh.
For in this book of Revelation the <span class="smcap">Lamb</span> does not mean an animal, but the
<span class="smcap">Lamb</span> of <span class="smcap">God</span>. The beast does not mean a literal wild beast, but the
spiritual wild beast who destroys the children of <span class="smcap">God</span>. So the twelve
thousand of the tribe of Judah refers to the praising ones of <span class="smcap">Christ's</span>
fold; the sealed of Asher to the happy ones, who bless the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> at all
times; those of Naphtali, to those satisfied with favour, full with the
blessing of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>; those of Reuben, to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="page85" id="page85">[Pg 85]</a></span> once unstable as water,
but now fully saved ones; &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>In Rev. xiii we find the great tribulation in progress, and those still
left on the earth persecuted sorely, many of them to the death, by the
beast. But the hundred forty and four thousand of Rev. xiv are not among
them; they were caught up before the tribulation commenced, having been
accounted worthy (Luke xxi. 34-36), to escape the things coming on the
earth, and to stand before the <span class="smcap">Son</span> of <span class="smcap">Man</span>. Such are not only virgins,
undefiled by spiritual adultery with the world, but also wise ones,
filled with the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span>: they are not only waiting for the coming of the
Bridegroom, but ready for that coming; whereas the unwise have to go and
buy oil, and so miss their opportunity. In Rev. xiv we see that <span class="smcap">God's</span>
Name is<span class='pagenum'><a name="page86" id="page86">[Pg 86]</a></span> written on the foreheads of these wise virgins, and that in
their mouths is a song which no one else can sing. They are a
first-fruits Bride united to the first-fruit's Bridegroom, and were
redeemed (not from among the Jews only, but from among men), unto <span class="smcap">God</span>
and the <span class="smcap">Lamb</span>. Other believers, then in the tribulation, shall join them
later and form the harvest unto <span class="smcap">God</span> (Rev. vii. 14-17), and will come
with the Bridegroom and Bride when our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is revealed from heaven in
flaming fire to take vengeance on the ungodly (2 Thess. i, 6-10). The
harvest is not only separated from the first-fruits in Rev. vii and xiv,
but also in Rev. xx. We may read verses 4-6 more clearly if we render
the second clause of verse 4, "I saw also the souls of them, &amp;c.,"
instead of "and I saw, &amp;c." and the last clause, "They also lived and<span class='pagenum'><a name="page87" id="page87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
reigned with <span class="smcap">Christ</span> a thousand years." We thus see the enthroned
Bridegroom and Bride and the harvest, the Body of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, forming the
first resurrection, and together reigning in glory.</p>

<p><i>"And I will bless them."</i> A word of encouragement to Aaron and his sons
in pronouncing the blessing, as well as to the people who received it.
The blessing was preceded by <span class="smcap">God's</span> command ("Speak unto Aaron ... On
this wise ye shall bless"), and followed by the promise quoted above;
even as our <span class="smcap">Saviour</span> in giving His last commission to disciple all
nations, preceded it by, "All power is given unto Me...: Go ye
therefore;" and followed it by the assurance and promise, "Lo, I am with
you alway." In the word of a King there is power; and when His servants
carry out His commands, our <span class="smcap">King</span> is present to authenticate them, and to
ensure the result.</p>

<h2>PART III.</h2>

<h3>Princely Service.</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Numb. vii.</span></h3>

<p>We learned from Numbers vi, <span class="smcap">God's</span> requirements of those who desire to
take the privileged position of separation to Himself. We found also in
the conclusion of the same chapter the overflow of <span class="smcap">God's</span> love in the
rich and comprehensive blessing which so appropriately follows, and
forms the connecting link between Nazarite separation and the princely
service set forth in Chap. vii,&mdash;one of the longest in the Bible, and
one full of repetition. We now propose to consider more fully why this
service of giving finds such lengthy record.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page89" id="page89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<h3>SERVICE THE CONSTRAINT OF LOVE.</h3>

<p>Is it not that just as separation to <span class="smcap">God</span> issues in blessing, so does
blessing from <span class="smcap">God</span> constrain to service, and especially to the highest
form of service, that which is most <span class="smcap">God</span>-like, that of <i>Giving</i>? <span class="smcap">God</span> so
loved the world that He <i>gave</i>; <span class="smcap">Christ</span> so loved the Church that He
<i>gave</i>; the <span class="smcap">Holy Spirit</span> so loves the Church that He <i>gives</i>; and
redeemed ones, created anew in <span class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span> unto good works, when led by
the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span>, first <i>give</i> themselves unto <span class="smcap">God</span>, and then delight in such
other free-will offerings as the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> may enable them to present. This
we believe is the reason why the chapter is found here, and is the true
connection between its subject-matter and that of the preceding one.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page90" id="page90">[Pg 90]</a></span>But why is it so long, so repetitious, and so tedious? The Bible is a
wonderful book; it not only gives the history of the past, and guidance
for the present, but in prophecy we have the history of ages yet to
come&mdash;the course of events until the grand climax when <span class="smcap">God</span> shall be all
in all. Why, in a book so marvellous in its comprehensiveness, is so
much space given to this record?</p>

<h3>GOD'S DELIGHT IN LOVE-GIFTS.</h3>

<p>Is it not in order to reveal the heart of <span class="smcap">God</span>? to show His delight in
the loving offerings of His servants? The record is <i>not</i> tedious to
Him; and it becomes marvellously interesting to us, when we get the key,
and are brought into sympathy with the heart of Him who finds infinite
satisfaction in each<span class='pagenum'><a name="page91" id="page91">[Pg 91]</a></span> gift, of each one of His children, which is the
outcome of gratitude and love.</p>

<p>In the days of our <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> life on earth, when the shadow of the cross
was already upon Him, one only amongst all His followers&mdash;a woman,
Mary&mdash;had understood and really taken in His repeated declaration of the
sufferings that awaited Him; and when she came to anoint Him beforehand
for the burial, and broke the precious alabaster box <i>she had reserved
for this very purpose</i>, the thief who kept the bag had only angry words
of criticism and reproach. How sweet to her wounded spirit was her
<span class="smcap">Master's</span> commendation, "She hath done what she could!" And He added,
"Wheresoever this Gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world,
this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page92" id="page92">[Pg 92]</a></span>On an earlier occasion, likewise, as He sat over against the treasury,
many that were rich cast in large sums of silver and of gold, but He
turned from them and their gifts to draw attention to a certain poor
widow who brought two mites and cast them in. She had gladdened the
heart of Him who was the Creator of all wealth, and the real Owner of it
all. She, said He, had given more than they all: for she <i>of her want</i>
had given <i>all</i> that she had! And of her, as of Mary, it is true that in
whatsoever language the Word of <span class="smcap">God</span> is translated, in whatsoever clime
it is read, the <span class="smcap">Master's</span> commendation is made known.</p>

<p>There is a day coming, in which before assembled worlds He will make
manifest the loving gifts and the secret service of His redeemed ones.
Then we shall not weary as they are recounted<span class='pagenum'><a name="page93" id="page93">[Pg 93]</a></span> and rewarded; and as we
see His joy in them all, we shall better understand the length of
Numbers vii.</p>

<h3>FREE-WILL OFFERINGS: verses 1, 2.</h3>

<p class="blockquot"><i>"And it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the
tabernacle, and had anointed it, and sanctified it ... and all the
vessels thereof, ... that the princes of Israel, heads of the house of
their fathers, ... offered."</i></p>

<p>When the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> gave the plan of the tabernacle and of the vessels, He
likewise gave to the people willing hearts to offer, and skill to
execute. There was no need to press them; the workers and contributors
were those whose heart stirred them up, and whose spirit was made
willing. The people brought more than enough for the service of the
work, and Moses had to make proclamation throughout<span class='pagenum'><a name="page94" id="page94">[Pg 94]</a></span> the camp to
restrain them from bringing more.</p>

<p>Is there not a lesson to be learnt here? Let the work only be one of
<span class="smcap">God's</span> planning, and executed according to His mind, and the hearts that
are in sympathy with Him will gladly respond with suitable and abundant
offerings. For is not the willingness to give as much a part of His
working as the skill to use that which is given? Then, in the givers and
in their gifts, in the workers and in their work, the Divine heart finds
infinite complacency. "For of Him," as the great Designer, "and through
Him," as the effectual Power for the carrying out of His purposes, "and
to Him," as the real Object of all service, "are all things: to whom be
the glory for ever. Amen."</p>

<p>But divine service requires not only initiating, but also maintaining
worthily<span class='pagenum'><a name="page95" id="page95">[Pg 95]</a></span> of <span class="smcap">God</span>. It was not sufficient that the tabernacle and the
vessels of ministry were according to the divine pattern, both as to
material and workmanship, and that they were made by divinely qualified
workmen; but when all was completed and fully set up, both the
tabernacle and the vessels needed anointing and sanctifying; and <i>when
that was done</i> the offerings needed to carry on the service could not
but be freely poured in. In like manner in all life and work, individual
or organised, only let <span class="smcap">God</span> have His right place, and let there be <i>the
anointing</i> of the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>, received by faith, as well as consecration
to Him, and everything will follow, as needful, for the carrying out of
<span class="smcap">God's</span> plan in the life or work.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page96" id="page96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<h3>GLADSOME ACCEPTANCE: verses 3-5.</h3>

<p class="blockquot"><i>"And they brought their offering before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, six covered wagons,
and twelve oxen; ... and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake unto Moses, saying, Take it of
them, that they may be to do the service of the tabernacle of the
congregation; and thou shall give them unto the Levites, to every man
according to his service."</i></p>

<p>It is interesting to note that the first offerings recorded were for the
purpose of assisting in the moving of the tabernacle; it was not <span class="smcap">God's</span>
purpose that it should be stationary. Nor is <span class="smcap">God's</span> work ever intended to
be stationary, but always advancing.</p>

<p>The offerings themselves were remarkable: rude bullock-wagons, probably
rough both in material and workmanship, much like those we now are
familiar with in the unchanging East; they must have presented a
striking contrast to the beauty of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="page97" id="page97">[Pg 97]</a></span> skilfully prepared vessels of
ministry. We may well imagine the thought to have passed through the
mind of Moses, Can such rude offerings be acceptable to the glorious
<span class="smcap">God</span>? But <span class="smcap">God</span> Himself dispels all doubt, by saying, "Take it of them."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">God</span> is not hard to please, nor is true human love, for it is a dim
reflection of His own. We do not estimate our love-gifts by their
intrinsic value, but rather by the love they express. Well do we
remember a little incident which occurred some twenty-four years ago,
and which illustrates this truth.</p>

<p>My little daughter, then about five years old, came to me on the morning
of my birthday with a curious little birthday gift in her hand,&mdash;"Papa,
I haven't bought you a birthday present," said she; "I thought you would
rather<span class='pagenum'><a name="page98" id="page98">[Pg 98]</a></span> have something I made myself." How my heart went out to the
little darling, and how glad I was that she should think that something
she could make would be more precious to me than any purchased gift! But
what the curious little gift could be intended for I was quite at a loss
to divine, and I engaged her in conversation, hoping she might let some
clue slip that would help me to find out for what she meant it, for I
feared she would be disappointed if I did not recognize it. The little
pet had found a small piece of wood, and had bored a hole in it with her
scissors, in which she had inserted a peg, and on the top had hung half
a cockle-shell&mdash;certainly an uncommon birthday present!</p>

<p>At last, unable to guess what it was supposed to be, I took my dear
child on my knee, and, kissing her, said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="page99" id="page99">[Pg 99]</a></span> "Papa is so pleased to have a
birthday present of your own making; what is it my darling has made for
me?" "Why, don't you know, papa? I thought you would like best a ship to
take you to China!"</p>

<p>The dear child was right; probably no gift I ever received gave more
pleasure, or was as carefully treasured, and as often thought of. When
that dear child had become old enough to engage in missionary work in
China herself, and was able to introduce me to the first two Chinese
women whom she had brought to <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, I remembered the little ship; and
when the women were gone reminded her about it, and told her that the
joy of finding her now used of <span class="smcap">God</span> in the blessed work itself was a
greater joy than her gift had been. She was surprised that I should
remember it; but it had<span class='pagenum'><a name="page100" id="page100">[Pg 100]</a></span> never passed from my memory, and the
recollection of it is a pleasure still. It is not hard to please those
who love us.<a name="FNanchor_A_4" id="FNanchor_A_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_4" class="fnanchor">D</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">God</span> <i>wants our love</i>; "My son, give Me thine heart." He wants our
<i>sympathy</i>; He wants the gifts and offerings that are prompted by
<i>love</i>. Shall He look to us in vain? Our David still thirsts, not for
the waters of the well of Bethlehem, but for the souls for which He
died. Shall He not have them? He specially needs willing, skilful young
men, ready to break through the enemy's camp to deliver the captives of
the mighty one. Who that can will go? Who that cannot go at present will
help others to go?</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_4" id="Footnote_A_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_4"><span class="label">D</span></a> While preparing these sheets for the press we learn from a
telegram that He whom my dear daughter had served in China since 1885,
has called her (and her baby of sixteen months) from her husband, the
Rev. J. J. Coulthard, and three surviving children, to the eternal home
above.</p></div>

<h3>ACCORDING TO HIS SERVICE: verses 5-9.</h3>

<p class="blockquot"><i>"Thou shall give them unto the Levites, to every man according to his
service. And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the
Levites. Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon,
according to their service, and four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto
the sons of Merari, according unto their service, under the hand of
Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. But unto the sons of Kohath he gave
none; because the service of the sanctuary belonging unto them was that
they should bear upon their shoulders."</i></p>

<p>The princes brought their offering to the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> accepted
it. Having accepted it Himself it was His to give to whom He would; and
He chose to give it to the Levites, for they in a special manner were
His, and devoted to His service.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page102" id="page102">[Pg 102]</a></span>The tribe of Levi was in one sense the poorest in Israel. In dividing
the land among the tribes, no territory was allotted to them. They will
have territory by-and-by, when the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> comes (<i>see</i> Ezek. xlviii.
12-14), but never have they had any yet. Cities to dwell in, and
suburbs, were given them here and there, in all the tribes of Israel,
but of earthly portion that was all.</p>

<p>And yet they were the richest tribe in Israel, for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> Himself was
their inheritance. When one of the other tribes was taken into
captivity, he had to leave his inheritance behind; but the godly Levite
was as rich in Babylon as in Palestine: death itself could not rob him
of his portion. Happy indeed are they who share the Levite's lot! When
the <span class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span> comes again, those, surely, who have stored most in
heaven, and have least<span class='pagenum'><a name="page103" id="page103">[Pg 103]</a></span> to leave behind on earth, will render their
account with the greatest joy.</p>

<p><i>"To every man according to his service."</i> The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> did not say, divide
it equally among the families of Levi. There were six wagons, and three
families of Levites; but four wagons were given to Merari, two to
Gershon, "but unto the sons of Kohath he gave none." At first sight this
division appears unfair; but it was and still is the <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> plan to give
"to every man according to his service." It fell to the lot of Merari to
carry the heaviest materials of the tabernacle; the boards, the bars,
and the pillars with their heavy sockets of solid silver,<a name="FNanchor_A_5" id="FNanchor_A_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_5" class="fnanchor">E</a> and all the
instruments; the pillars of the court, likewise, with their brazen<span class='pagenum'><a name="page104" id="page104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
sockets and pins, and their cords,&mdash;these formed Merari's weighty
burden.</p>

<p>The duty of Gershon was to convey the curtains, hangings, coverings and
cords of the tabernacle, and the hangings of the court; for this
service, two wagons were as sufficient help as the four were for Merari.</p>

<p>But what of Kohath? His burdens were not light: the ark, with its
covering the mercy-seat, and the cherubim of gold overshadowing it, the
table and the candlestick, the altars and the vessels of the sanctuary,
and all their coverings, these were entrusted to his sons. Heavy they
were indeed, but no help had they, "because the service of the sanctuary
belonging unto them was that they should bear upon their shoulders."</p>

<p>Sometimes the children of <span class="smcap">God</span> are tempted to murmur when their service<span class='pagenum'><a name="page105" id="page105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
seems heavy and but little help is forthcoming: they may perhaps compare
their lot with that of others for whom larger provision has been made.
But <span class="smcap">God</span> makes no mistakes; according to their service He divides the
help, and those who are called to the holiest service are those who can
have least assistance. Such are privileged to carry upon their own
shoulders sacred burdens that may not be shared with less privileged
ones. There was <span class="smcap">One</span> Who trod the winepress alone, and of the people
there was none with Him; and one who was very like to his <span class="smcap">Master</span> tells
us, "At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me....
Notwithstanding the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me
the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might
hear." Those who would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="page106" id="page106">[Pg 106]</a></span> near the <span class="smcap">Master</span> in the glory must here drink
the cup of sorrow with Him and be baptized with His baptism.</p>

<p>The burden-bearing of the Levites was not to last for ever: once in the
Promised Land that service ceased. Nor will our opportunity of
burden-bearing be for long; the glorious appearing of our great <span class="smcap">God</span> and
<span class="smcap">Saviour</span> will soon summons the watchful and waiting ones to meet Him in
the air. A million a month in China are dying without <span class="smcap">God</span>; now we may
seek to win them; now we may suffer to win them. May none of us lose the
opportunity of self-denial and service while it lasts!</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">THE DEDICATORY OFFERINGS:</span> verses 10, 11.</h3>

<p class="blockquot"><i>"And the princes offered for dedicating of the altar in the day that it
was anointed.... And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses, They shall offer their
offering, each prince on his day, for the dedicating of the altar."</i></p>

<p>The offerings recorded in the early verses of this chapter were given in
connection with the setting up of the Tabernacle, and had reference to
its transportation. But the offerings now to be considered had reference
to the altar, and the sacrifices to be offered thereon. Their number,
their character, and their value are full of sig<span class='pagenum'><a name="page108" id="page108">[Pg 108]</a></span>nificance; and the
space accorded to their record by <span class="smcap">God</span> shows the Divine estimation of the
altar, and of those gifts which pertain to sacrifice to Him.</p>

<p>The altar points us to our incarnate <span class="smcap">Saviour</span>, the <span class="smcap">Christ</span> of <span class="smcap">God</span>, and
reminds us that <i>without shedding of blood there is no remission of
sin</i>. The altar sanctified the gift; the fire on the altar first came
down from heaven; all fire that did not come from the altar was strange
fire, and could only bring death to the offerer when used in worship, as
in the case of Nadab and Abihu.</p>

<p>Do we not need to remember this in the present day, when false teachers
deny the atoning character of the death of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, and vainly imagine
that <span class="smcap">God</span> can be served with the unhallowed fires of fleshly activity?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page109" id="page109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE DISPLAY OF THE GIFTS.</h3>

<p>The twelve princes, the representatives of the Israel of <span class="smcap">God</span>, brought
their offerings before the altar, and would have left them there: they
were all exactly alike, and the gifts might have been speedily accepted,
and briefly recorded, if recorded at all. But the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Moses,
They shall offer their offering, each prince on his day,&mdash;or, literally,
<i>one prince a day</i>, a sentence which is expressed twice in the Original,
showing <span class="smcap">God's</span> regard for order and method in all things which concern
His service, and that He graciously receives and remembers the offerings
of each of His faithful. Accordingly all the offerings of each of the
princes are here registered by the <span class="smcap">Holy Spirit</span> in <span class="smcap">God's</span> Book, as an
encouragement<span class='pagenum'><a name="page110" id="page110">[Pg 110]</a></span> to Christian liberality in all ages" (<i>Wordsworth</i>).</p>

<p>Does it not seem as though the Divine delight in the offering of His
servants was so great that He would have His people also to dwell upon
them for twelve consecutive days? And not only does He spread them over
twelve days, but He spreads them over seventy-seven long verses in this
long chapter; first in minute detail, according as much space to the
gifts of the last offerer as to those of the first, and then totalling
up the aggregate amount, as though He would say, "Behold the love-gifts
of my people! How many and how precious the offerings of each, and how
great the value of the whole! Note, too, the persons of the offerers,
and that all their gifts were for the dedication of the altar, and show
their appreciation of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="page111" id="page111">[Pg 111]</a></span> need for, and the blessed privilege of
sacrifice!"</p>

<p>As we mentioned in our introductory chapter, it was through this
account, read in a time of great spiritual need, that our mind was
opened as never before to see <span class="smcap">God's</span> great heart of love. We seemed to be
reminded of the delight often taken by bride and bridegroom in spreading
out for inspection the love-gifts of their friends, that as many as
possible may share their gratification in them. Several may have sent
similar gifts; but each is set out to the best possible advantage, with
the name of the giver attached. And while the intrinsic value of each is
not lost sight of, it is the loving thought of which it is the
expression that is most prized.</p>

<p>Again, we were reminded of the way in which, in our frequent absence<span class='pagenum'><a name="page112" id="page112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
from home and children, wifely letters have cheered and interested us,
depicting with motherly tenderness the gifts the children had brought
her on her birthday, or other occasion, with a fulness of detail that
showed alike the pleasure of the writer and her consciousness of the
enjoyment with which the account would be read. Does not the full detail
of this chapter reveal, in like manner, the love and tenderness of Him
whose Book it is, toward each offerer; and bring out what we may
reverently call the mother-side of <span class="smcap">God's</span> character, Who has condescended
to say, "As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you"?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page113" id="page113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE PERSON OF THE OFFERER. verses 12-17.</h3>

<p class="blockquot"><i>"And he that offered his offering the first day was Nahshon the son of
Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah:" etc.</i></p>

<p>As we read of the offerings of the twelve princes, we note that,
valuable as they manifestly are, the offerer whose love prompted the
gifts, is made more prominent in the inspired Record. The person of each
offerer is brought before us, both as an individual, and in his
relationship to the tribe of which he is the representative, before any
enumeration is made of his gifts; and when the enumeration has been
fully given, we are again reminded of the offerer himself. Could the
Divine love and satisfaction be more expressively brought out?</p>

<p>With this thought in view, let us<span class='pagenum'><a name="page114" id="page114">[Pg 114]</a></span> read between the lines of the
Record:&mdash;</p>

<p>And he that offered his offering&mdash;for a glad free-will offering it
was&mdash;on the first day was Nahshon, Nahshon the son of Amminadab, Nahshon
the prince of the tribe of Judah; and his offering was one charger&mdash;a
silver charger, and a weighty one; the weight thereof was a hundred and
thirty shekels: one bowl, also of silver, of seventy shekels weight; not
the light shekels of commerce, but the weighty shekels of the Sanctuary.
Nor were these vessels empty: both of them were full&mdash;full of flour,
fine flour, and mingled with oil, destined for a meat-offering.</p>

<p>One spoon was the next gift, yet more precious, a spoon of solid gold,
of no less than ten shekels weight. It, too, was full&mdash;full of incense.<span class='pagenum'><a name="page115" id="page115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>Next were brought one young bullock, one ram, and one lamb of the first
year&mdash;all for a burnt-offering. Any one of these might have been
offered; Nahshon, however, brought them all, and all to be wholly
consumed on the altar, for the enjoyment and satisfaction of <span class="smcap">God</span> alone.</p>

<p>But Nahshon was a sinner, and the tribe he represented were sinful men;
a sin-offering therefore was not neglected; and in the order of
enumeration this is next mentioned, though, as we have said before, it
was offered first&mdash;one kid of the goats for a sin-offering.</p>

<p>And, lastly, a princely offering for a sacrifice of peace-offerings; two
oxen, five rams, five he-goats, five lambs of the first year&mdash;sacrifices
on which <span class="smcap">God</span> feasted, as it were, together with His people, and in which
the sacrificing<span class='pagenum'><a name="page116" id="page116">[Pg 116]</a></span> priest, the offerer and all his friends had their full
share.</p>

<p>And this, all this, was the offering of Nahshon, Nahshon the son of
Amminadab.</p>

<p>Twelve times is all this detail repeated&mdash;a most emphatic evidence that
<span class="smcap">God</span> never wearies in noting the service of each one of His people. But
even this is not all. In the 84th and following verses of this long
chapter we read:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This was the dedication of the altar, in the day when it was anointed,
by the princes of Israel: twelve chargers of silver, twelve silver
bowls, twelve spoons of gold. Each charger of silver weighing a hundred
and thirty shekels, each bowl seventy: all the silver vessels weighed
two thousand and four hundred shekels, after the shekel of the
Sanctuary. The golden spoons were twelve, full of incense, weighing
twelve shekels<span class='pagenum'><a name="page117" id="page117">[Pg 117]</a></span> apiece, after the shekel of the Sanctuary; all the gold
of the spoons was a hundred and twenty shekels.</p>

<p>"All the oxen for the burnt-offering were twelve bullocks, the rams
twelve, the lambs of the first year twelve, with their meat-offering;
and the kids of the goats for sin-offering twelve. And all the oxen for
the sacrifice of the peace-offerings were twenty and four bullocks, the
rams sixty, the he-goats sixty, the lambs of the first year sixty.</p>

<p>"This"&mdash;<i>all this</i>&mdash;"was the dedication of the altar, after that it was
anointed."</p>

<h3>THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ALTAR.</h3>

<p>In this glad summing up of the great aggregate value of the offerings,
we not only get a further view of the Divine complacency in the
love-gifts of<span class='pagenum'><a name="page118" id="page118">[Pg 118]</a></span> His people, and in the persons of the offerers, but the
object of the offerings is also brought into special prominence. As the
list of each prince's offerings was preceded and followed by reference
to the <i>person</i> of the offerer, so the list of totals is preceded and
followed by the thought, This was the dedication of the altar in the day
when it was anointed.</p>

<p>The importance of the brazen altar can scarcely be exaggerated. The
Tabernacle contained many precious things, each typifying most important
truths concerning our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> and His ministry; the ark on which rested the
Shekinah, which enshrined the tables of the law, and was covered by the
mercy-seat, the table of shew-bread, the candlestick of gold, and the
golden altar were all most precious; but, apart from the brazen altar,
<i>there was no access to</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="page119" id="page119">[Pg 119]</a></span> <i>them for guilty man</i>; without shedding of
blood there is no remission of sin. Hence the recognition by the princes
of the importance of the altar; and hence the Divine emphasis placed
upon those gifts&mdash;an emphasis wholly without parallel in the sacred
Records. To the godly Israelite the brazen altar typified that which was
fulfilled at the Cross, and well may we exclaim: "<span class="smcap">God</span> forbid that I
should glory, save in the Cross of our <span class="smcap">Lord Jesus Christ</span>" (Gal. vi. 14).</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Looking back over the two chapters on which we have been dwelling we see
in them a marvellous revelation of Divine love&mdash;even in Mosaic times.
First, an unrestricted invitation to draw near to <span class="smcap">God</span>; woman or man, of
any tribe&mdash;whosoever will&mdash;may come and be wholly separated unto the
<span class="smcap">Lord<span class='pagenum'><a name="page120" id="page120">[Pg 120]</a></span></span>&mdash;but only in <span class="smcap">God's</span> way. We learn, too, that in such consecration
there is no merit on which man may rest, or in which he may boast; we
are at best unprofitable servants, accepted only in the <span class="smcap">Beloved</span>,
complete only in Him. Yet such consecration gives joy to <span class="smcap">God</span>, and opens
the way to wonderful revelations of blessing; blessing which when
enjoyed constrains to service, to gift, to recognition of the
preciousness of the Altar, of the Cross&mdash;a service in which <span class="smcap">God</span> Himself
finds delight, and on which He never wearies to dwell.</p>

<p>May <span class="smcap">God</span> make our meditations very practical; and may we "thus judge,
that if <span class="smcap">One</span> died for all, then were all dead; and that He died for all,
that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but
unto Him which died for them and rose again,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="page121" id="page121">[Pg 121]</a></span>&mdash;or, as we may better
read it, "unto Him which died and rose again for them."</p>

<p>Are we really thus living? <span class="smcap">God</span> knows: eternity will show: what answer
does conscience give now? What conclusions do our brothers, sisters,
children, friends draw from our lives? Our true self-denial,
self-emptying, and giving for <span class="smcap">Christ's</span> cause practically show <i>our</i> real
estimate of the value of the Cross of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, our real love for the
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> who was crucified for us.</p>
